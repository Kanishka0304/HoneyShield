## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Build Plan

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Honeypot Engine

1. Create multi-threaded TCP socket server.
2. Simulate SSH/HTTP/FTP banners (e.g. SSH: `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1`).
3. Log:
   - Timestamp
   - IP address
   - Port
   - Payload (e.g. password attempts)
4. Save logs to `logs/session_TIMESTAMP.json`

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Structured Logging

1. Design log schema:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-13T14:55:21Z",
  "ip": "192.168.0.10",
  "port": 22,
  "protocol": "SSH",
  "payload": "admin:1234"
}
